# 👋 Hi, I'm Varun (xivks)

**Aspiring Apple SRD Researcher | Bugcrowd Verified | Focused on Webhook & API Behavior Analysis**


I have a strong passion for **Apple device security** and have been exploring iOS internals 
and security surfaces since my college days. My focus areas align with Apple’s ongoing 
research challenges, particularly around **Private Cloud Compute**, **Beta Software regressions**, 
and **Lockdown Mode** protections.

---

## 🎯 Research Focus
- **Private Cloud Compute (PCC):** Threat models, attestation integrity, and potential side-channel risks.  
- **Beta Regressions:** Identifying issues unique to developer/public beta releases, including reintroduced bugs.  
- **Lockdown Mode:** Testing restrictions, analyzing parsers, and spotting bypass opportunities.  

---

## 🛠️ Current Work
- Building fuzzing harnesses for **plist/JSON-like parsers**.  
- Documenting research methodologies and security reporting templates.  
- Actively participating in **Bugcrowd** and preparing for Apple’s Security Bounty program.
